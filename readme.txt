Generate random aviation quotes on your WordPress website using shortcode.

== Description ==

**Aviation Quotes** is a very simple plugin that'll generate a random aviation quote on your website every hour.

Features include:

* Customize how the quote renders on your page.
* Data is cached locally (using the WordPress transient API) for 60 minutes.

The plugin was developed for the [Flight.org](http://www.flight.org/ "Flight") website since no other tool was available.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What will the plugin do?**

The aviation quotes plugin will retrieve a random aviation quote from our API and display the data anywhere on your website.

**I can't see shortcode in my WordPress sidebar. What should I do?**

There's an option to uncomment a single line at the bottom of the aviation-quotes.php file that'll enable shortcodes in widgets. The alternative is to install another plugin that provides the option in a form (Hiztory).

**What are the plans for the future?**

We plan on implementing a large number of improvements. They include:

* Bulding upon our strong database of over 5000 quotes.
* Submit your own quotes back to us.
* Additional formatting options.
* Request quote based on specific keywords or type of quote (history, comedy etc.)
